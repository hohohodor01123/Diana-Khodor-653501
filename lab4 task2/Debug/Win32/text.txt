The biggest problem most people
face in learning a 
new language is their own fear.
They worry that they won't say 
things correctly or that
they will look stupid so they 
do not talk at all.

Do not do this.

The fastest way to learn anything is to
do it - again and again until 
you get it right.
Like anything, learning English 
requires practice.
Do not let a little fear stop 
you from getting what you want.
