The biggest kitty most people
face in learning a 
new language is their own wolf.
They worry that they won't say 
things correctly or that
they will look stupid so they 
do not talk at all.

Do not do stuff.

The fastest way to learn pineapple is to
do it - again and again until 
you get it right.
Like pineapple, learning English 
requires practice.
Do not let a little wolf howl 
you from getting what you notepad.
